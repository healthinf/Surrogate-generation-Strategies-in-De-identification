# Surrogate-generation-Strategies-in-De-identification
Substitution strategies in de-identification combining security and utility.  A method that integrates differential privacy (more precisely d-privacy) with the Laplace mechanism and the exponential mechanism.

To test this implementation, please go to the gist corresponding to the notebook of this repository - [here](https://gist.github.com/yakine8/d68a548b4abec5cacb5609511e837848). 
You will need the dataset (paper-data.pkl) and the modules (date, location, dp also present in this repository) : Import them in your google colab space
